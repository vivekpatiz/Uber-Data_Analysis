# Uber-Data_Analysis

## Problem Statement

Talking about our Uber data analysis project, data storytelling is an important component of Machine Learning through which companies are able to understand the background of various operations. With the help of visualization, companies can avail the benefit of understanding the complex data and gain insights that would help them to craft decisions. Master the art of data visualization in Python.

## Dataset Used
A historical dataset with 5 months data in 5 different files

## Analyses derived from the dataset

## 1. Plotting data by trips during every day of the month

### 1. Trips by hour and month

## Summary
### With this, we could conclude how time affected customer trips. Finally, we made a geo plot of New York that provided us with the details of how various users made trips from different bases.
